## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 6
  One of my favorite labs this semester was lab 6, part-2. The reason I enjoyed this lab so much was because I would play Blackjack on video games as I grew up. So being able to write a code that allows a user to play Blackjack was cool to do.

* Lab 8
  Another one of my favorite labs this semester was lab 8, part-1. The reason I enjoyed this lab was because of the concept of having a user make a sandwich. Then putting the order into a proper sentence, I thought this was interesting to do.

* Lab 10
  Another one of my favorite labs this semester was lab 10, part-1. The reason I enjoyed this lab was because I wouldn't have thought that I could type a code that gets prime numbers.
